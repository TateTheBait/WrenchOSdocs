  <h1>About Project WrenchOS</h1>
  <p1>WrenchOS is an addon that has the same functions as your average framework, but runs at 0ms server and client sided.</p1>
  <p2>The main goal of this project is to have sufficient addons for smaller frameworks like ox_core and ND_Core</p2>
  <p3>WrenchOS Comes with quite a few exports and alot of player data. with a really good database that stores everything scripters could need.</p3>
  <p4>WrenchOS has "jobs", player names (in progress), cash/banking exports, active playerids and fairly good systems that make it easier to script in smaller frameworks.</p4>
  <p5>This is all setup when players join your server for the first time, creating their own row in your mysql database that stores their data forever.</p5>
  <p6>This is basically a big utility script.</p6>
  <p7>!!!!!All exports can be used on client and server equally.!!!!!</p7>
  <p8>(This will be used in my future scripts)</p7>
