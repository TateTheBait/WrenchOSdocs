  <h1>About Project WrenchOS</h1>

  <p>
    WrenchOS is a highly efficient addon that functions similarly to your average framework but runs at <span class="highlight">0ms server and client-side</span>, offering top-tier performance.
  </p>

  <p>
    The main objective of this project is to provide sufficient addons for smaller frameworks like <span class="highlight">ox_core</span> and <span class="highlight">ND_Core</span>, making scripting easier and more streamlined.
  </p>

  <p>
    WrenchOS comes packed with numerous exports and extensive player data, all supported by a robust database system that stores everything a scripter would need.
  </p>

  <p>
    It includes features such as <span class="highlight">jobs, player names (in progress), cash/banking exports, active player IDs</span>, and a set of well-optimized systems, making it a perfect fit for smaller frameworks.
  </p>

  <p>
    All player data is stored automatically when they join the server for the first time, creating a dedicated row in your MySQL database that securely holds their information permanently.
  </p>

  <p>
    In essence, <span class="highlight">WrenchOS is a powerful utility script</span> that enhances the efficiency and capability of smaller frameworks.
  </p>

  <p class="highlight">
    Important: All exports can be used both on the client and server sides equally!
  </p>

  <p>
    (WrenchOS will be integrated into my future scripts as well.)
